# CONTRIBUTING

This is an open source project so feel free to contribute. Follow the guidelines of submitting a PR.

## Ways of Contributing

### You can contribute to the project by:
* Adding feature
* Reporting bugs
* Solving issues
* Improving code quality
* Improving documentation

### Steps to contribute to the code of this project:
1. Fork the repository,
2. Update it with your contribution,
3. Send a pull request to the repository.

Please note there is no need to ask permission to work on an issue. You should check for pull requests linked to an issue you are addressing; if there are none, then assume nobody has done anything. Begin to fix the problem, test, make your commits, push your commits, then make a pull request. Mention an issue number in the pull request, but not the commit message. These practices allow the competition of ideas and give priority to meritocracy.

Thanks in advance for your contribution.
